check_ip.py explanation

The script in question has been tested on 2.7.6 on the provided Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS Vagrant box.

It's set to UTF-8 format because, due to past work with video editing and subtitles with non-Roman
characters, I use UTF-8 with everything.

First, it obviously imports necessary Python modules in order to function properly, such as urllib2 for directly querying HTTP URLs.

Next, it obtains the current date and time in a format that I find to both have all necessary data and be aesthetically pleasing. It then stores the
data in the variable datetimestamp

Next, the specified URL is stored as checkip.dyndns.org

Next, the URL in question is opened for reading with the urllib2.urlopen module

It then goes through a "Try -> Except" block to handle two exceptions I encountered while writing this script:
1. A timeout error due to network congestion, server load, who knows.
2. Receiving an unknown HTTP error.

Afterwards, the response goes through regex filtering to get just the IP address.

As it stands, the IP address is surrounded by angle brackets "[]" and single quotes "''". It looks ugly.
Pass it through join to get rid of that unwanted detritus, reusing the same variable as there is no need to create another one.

We are nearing completion. Open /home/vagrant/dyndns.log in append mode. Append mode so it can be added to; if opened in write
mode, it will be overwriten.
Write the date/time stamp and the resulting IP address in the requested format.
Close the file to avoid anything like data loss. And it's just common sense.
